  <div class="about">
<p>Envision Studios was founded in spring of 2023 <br>
  and consists of very few people.<br>
  Supporters include: Nate, Tim and a few others.<br>
  It started off with taking and editing pictures<br>
   of Star Wars ships.<br>
  After that it changed into full scale videos.<br>
  The videos weren't posted on youtube but were watched <br>
  by many friends and family.<br>
Envision Studios is yet to be an <br>
official business but will use as many supporters as possible.</p>
